# UrbanizationEffectReduction
the Problem that we are solving is reducing the effect of urbanization. Let me elaborate,  We construct buildings by deforesting a certain area/Sq Feet; due to this oxygen emission and carbon dioxide absorption are reduced drastically. Now our solution/idea is to provide/ say forecasting the number of trees and plants that can be planted in the left-out space/area after construction. 
**Note: The Correlation between the data is not good as the dataset is created using greedy apprach.**
